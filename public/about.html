<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Aspiring software developer currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science at Netaji Subhash Engineering College (NSEC), Kolkata. 
  My core strengths lie in Java development, including Java SE, Swing (where I built a Tic-Tac-Toe game incorporating the AI minimax 
  algorithm), JavaFX, and Object-Oriented Programming. I also have good grasp of Data Structures and Algorithms.</p>

<p>I'm currently expanding my skillset with web development and actively seeking internship opportunities where I can apply and 
  further develop my skills.</p>

<p>I'm passionate about technology and eager to connect with other professionals in the field. My long-term goal is to become a 
  highly skilled and impactful software engineer.
</p>
<p>When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me brewing a cup of tea or trying out a new recipe.</p>
